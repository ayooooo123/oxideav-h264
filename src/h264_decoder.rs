//! H.264 decoder scaffold exposed through the `oxideav_core::Decoder`
//! trait so containers + players can route packets at us.
//!
//! What this scaffold currently does:
//! 1. Accepts Annex B byte-stream packets or AVCC-framed packets
//!    (length prefix size taken from `extradata` when present — an
//!    `AVCDecoderConfigurationRecord` per ISO/IEC 14496-15).
//! 2. Walks NAL units through [`crate::decoder::Decoder`] which
//!    captures SPS/PPS and emits parsed slice headers.
//! 3. Maintains a decoded picture store ([`crate::ref_store::RefPicStore`])
//!    across pictures so P/B slices have reference pictures for
//!    motion compensation (§8.2.4 / §8.2.5).
//! 4. For every slice it parses, the decoder derives POC (§8.2.1),
//!    builds the RefPicList0 / RefPicList1 that §8.4.2 inter
//!    prediction consumes, runs `reconstruct::reconstruct_slice`, and
//!    queues the reconstructed Picture as a `VideoFrame` for
//!    `receive_frame`.
//!
//! Known simplifications (see inline comments for details):
//! - **Access unit assembly**: §7.4.1.2.4 multi-slice assembly IS
//!   implemented — continuation slices land in the same Picture +
//!   MbGrid as the first slice, and we finalize the picture (push to
//!   DPB + output queue) when a slice opens a new primary coded picture
//!   or on AUD / EndOfSequence / flush. Caveat: the deblocking pass in
//!   `reconstruct::reconstruct_slice` runs per-slice and walks the
//!   whole grid, so continuation slices may re-filter earlier slices'
//!   interior edges. See the comment on `handle_slice` for details.
//! - **Output ordering**: frames are emitted in display (POC) order
//!   via [`crate::dpb_output::DpbOutput`] per Annex C §C.2.2 / §C.4
//!   bumping process.
//! - **Field pictures (PAFF) / MBAFF**: PAFF field pictures
//!   (`field_pic_flag == 1`) decode as half-height pictures and the
//!   §C.4.4 driver pairs complementary opposite-parity fields into one
//!   full-height output frame. MBAFF (`mb_adaptive_frame_field_flag ==
//!   1`, `field_pic_flag == 0`) intra reconstructs; MBAFF inter (P/B)
//!   field-coded pairs are still deferred.
//! - **Reference picture list modification (RPLM)**: the ops are
//!   applied via `ref_list::modify_ref_pic_list`, but the underlying
//!   short-term / long-term derivation is a first pass and may not
//!   be fully spec-accurate for all streams.
//!
//! The trait is what oxideplay/oxideav-pipeline consumes; registering
//! this decoder (via [`crate::register`]) stops the "codec not found"
//! error on the first h264 packet.

/// "max_num_reorder_frames is a lower bound on what we can buffer"
/// real-world reading and what makes B-pyramid streams from
